### Using Translations

`<FormattedMessage id="app.text" defaultMessage="Mensageo"/>`
and the following import:
`import { FormattedMessage } from 'react-intl';`

2: Add the json reference in the all translations file:
`src/translations/en.json`
with the proper keys:
`"app.text": "your text here""`

You can find more options and information: https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl
